Vite + TailwindCSS + JavaScript (ES Modules)

The frontend is built using Vite as the development build tool and TailwindCSS for utility-first responsive styling. It follows a modular component approach where shared UI elements (such as headers, footers, and modals) are loaded dynamically via JavaScript partials.
