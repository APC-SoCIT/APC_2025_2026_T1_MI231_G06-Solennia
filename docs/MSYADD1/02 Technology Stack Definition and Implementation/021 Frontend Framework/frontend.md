Vite + TailwindCSS + JavaScript (ES Modules)

This folder contains documentation on the frontend technologies and architecture used in the Solennia project. The frontend is built using Vite as the development build tool and TailwindCSS for utility-first responsive styling. It follows a modular component approach where shared UI elements (such as headers, footers, and modals) are loaded dynamically via JavaScript partials.
